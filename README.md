# SurrealDude's Anni 10 area/s
This branch only includes the Fire temple area.\
Once this area is finished, I'll compare & pull request it into the main/head branch (which will include all of my areas eventually (if I actually make more than 1, ofc)).

## Info
- Current version: 0.5

### Area
- 1st Area: **Fire Temple**: _A hidden temple deep underground, dim-lit by fire, kindled by our past._

  - [ ] ~91% done
    - [X] 100% done content-wise
    - [ ] Music
    - [ ] Playtesting (probably needs some more still)
    - [X] Might have some visual changes (if needed)

## Anyway
I'll keep updating it over the next (many) months, if necessary. (Still missing the music, that's necessary for sure.)\
When it comes to playtesting, over these two years I'll probably need at the very least for Enana to play it, in case anything's horribly wrong with the area.\
But again, two years is a long time. That checkbox can remain unchecked as long as it needs to be, really.\
If I get bored before the deadline, maybe I'll feel like making another area?\
Idk. I don't plan on working on the second and third area for a few months (if at all), so whatever.
