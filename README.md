## Anyway
I made a custom track for it ("made" as in frankensteined a midi file, but sure), hopefully it doesn't give aids to everyone who listen to it or anything like that. Do let me know, if it Does, Do That.\
I don't plan on working on the second and third area for a few months (if at all), so there's that.
