# SurrealDude's Anni 10 area/s
This repository will include my 3 TEiN Anniversary 10 areas.
Unless I die or I don't have enough time to make more than 1 area I guess.

## Info
- Current version: 0.1

### Areas
- 1st Area: **Fire Temple**: __A hidden temple deep underground, dim-lit by fire, kindled by our past.__ Prefix: <ins>(sur1 + sur1x)</ins>, ~80% done (100% done content-wise, missing music, needs playtesting, might have some visual changes if needed)
- 2nd Area: **Rewind Gardens(?)**: __A garden stuck in time, clockwork made of marble.__ 0% done
- 3rd Area: **Resuscitation(?)**: __An abandoned facility, once on life support, and now revived (one last time.)__ 0% done

### Extra
Also I think I misunderstood and the area prefix should be an abbreviation of the area's name.
I might change 'sur1' to 'fir'/'ft' if that's the case, do let me know. The deco didn't end up playing a big role for the first area anyways.

## Anyway
That's about it for now, we'll see. Two years is a long time.
I don't plan on working on the second and third area for a few months, if at all, so that's cool.
