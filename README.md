# SurrealDude's Anni 10 area/s
This branch only includes the Fire temple area.
Once this area is considered completed, I'll compare & pull request it into the main/head branch (which will include all three areas eventually (if I actually make 3 areas, can't ever make promises)).

## Info
- Current version: 0.2

### Area
- 1st Area: **Fire Temple**: _A hidden temple deep underground, dim-lit by fire, kindled by our past._

    - [X] 100% done content-wise
    - [ ] Music
    - [ ] Playtesting
    - [ ] Might have some visual changes (if needed)

## Anyway
That's about it for now, we'll see. Two years is a long time.
I don't plan on working on the second and third area for a few months (if at all), so that's cool.
