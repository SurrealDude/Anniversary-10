# SurrealDude's Anni 10 area/s
This repository will include my 3 TEiN Anniversary 10 areas.
Unless I die or I don't have enough time to make more than 1 area I guess.
Only the first area is playable, I won't work on the other two right now.

## Info
- Current version: 0.2

### Areas
- 1st Area: **Fire Temple**: _A hidden temple deep underground, dim-lit by fire, kindled by our past._

## Anyway
That's about it for now, we'll see. Two years is a long time.
I don't plan on working on the second and third area for a few months, if at all, so that's cool.
