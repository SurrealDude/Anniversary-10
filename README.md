# SurrealDude's Anni 10 area/s
This branch only includes the Fire temple area.\
Once this area is finished, I'll compare & pull request it into the main/head branch (which will include all of my areas eventually (if I actually make more than 1, ofc)).

## Info
- Current version: 0.3

### Area
- 1st Area: **Fire Temple**: _A hidden temple deep underground, dim-lit by fire, kindled by our past._

  - [ ] ~85% done
    - [X] 100% done content-wise
    - [ ] Music
    - [ ] Playtesting
    - [ ] Might have some visual changes (if needed)

## Anyway
I'll keep updating it over the next months, if necessary. (Still missing the music, that's necessary for sure.)\
Two years is a long time, so maybe I'll feel like making another area?\
Idk. I don't plan on working on the second and third area for a few months (if at all), so that's cool.
